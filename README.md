### Repository for the paper 'Emotion Recognition from Speech Using Wav2vec 2.0 Embeddings' by Leonardo Pepino, Pablo Riera and Luciana Ferrer

Work in progress. All the configuration files and code to replicate the experiments are available, however some of the libraries that are used are still in process of being released.

Requirements:

We recommend running these scripts using a virtual environment like Anaconda, which should have Tensorflow and PyTorch installed.

Install required python packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install sox in your system
```
sudo apt-get install sox
```
